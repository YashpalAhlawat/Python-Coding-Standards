## For Example we have student database and we are fetching data then 


#### Methods names should be describing the purpose of the method e.g. method name get_data() vs get_student_data(). Second method clearly stating its purpose.
#### Variable names should be describing the purpose of variable e.g. a = 10 vs student_id = 10. In second case it is clearly describing its purpose.
#### Unit testing should cover all possible scenarios, example: what if we pass None/Empty/invalid inputs/valid inputs. Possible error case behaviors.
#### If transaction exists in code, we should not miss them in integration test cases.
